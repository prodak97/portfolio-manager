  - **Auto-save with visual feedback**: See when your data is being saved
  - **Backup system**: Automatic backups with recovery capabilities
  - **Error handling**: Graceful handling of storage failures
  - **Debounced saving**: Prevents excessive saves while typing

## Data Safety Features

### üõ°Ô∏è Automatic Saving
- **Real-time feedback**: Visual indicators show when data is being saved
- **Debounced saves**: Changes are saved 500ms after you stop typing
- **Save confirmation**: "‚úÖ All changes saved" message appears after successful saves

### üîÑ Backup System
- **Automatic backups**: Every save creates a timestamped backup
- **Backup recovery**: If primary data is corrupted, automatically recovers from backup
- **Backup management**: Keeps only the last 3 backups to save space

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling
- **Storage failure detection**: Alerts you if data cannot be saved
- **Graceful degradation**: Continues working even if localStorage is unavailable
- **Error recovery**: Automatic retry mechanisms for failed saves
 - **Safe JSON parsing**: Corrupted or invalid saved data/backups are safely ignored to prevent crashes

### üìä Data Management
- **Export functionality**: Download your portfolio data as JSON
- **Clear all data**: Safely reset to default values with confirmation
- **Data validation**: Ensures data integrity before saving

## How to Use

### Editing Your Portfolio

- Click the fixed "Download CV" button (bottom-right) to export the current portfolio view as a multi-page A4 PDF.
- The PDF uses a self-contained, print-friendly resume layout (no Tailwind) for reliability.
- Tip: Keep text concise; projects are condensed (top 6) to fit fewer pages.

### Import/Export Your Data

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## Technologies Used

- **React 18** - UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **CSS3** - Styling
- **localStorage** - Data persistence
- **html2canvas + jsPDF** - Client-side PDF generation for the CV export
- **TypeScript + React** - Typed UI and data flow

## Customization

You can customize the application by:

1. **Adding new skill categories**: Modify the form in `App.tsx`
2. **Changing colors**: Update the CSS variables in `App.css`
3. **Adding new fields**: Extend the Project or Skill interfaces
4. **Modifying layout**: Adjust the CSS grid and flexbox properties

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Dependencies not found**: Run `npm install` again
2. **Port already in use**: The dev server will automatically use a different port
3. **Data not saving**: Check if localStorage is enabled in your browser
4. **TypeScript errors**: Make sure all dependencies are properly installed


## Changelog

- Project start and end dates display in dd/mm/yy format.
- Added Core Competencies section with category + description.
- Added Additional Details section (category + description) with editor and display.
- Implemented Resume URL field and "View Resume" link in Contact.

- Storage quota exceeded: Backups auto-trim; clear site storage if needed.
- Import errors: Ensure the JSON matches the schema; at minimum `name` and `email` are required.
- Moved additional details to the end of portfolio.

## Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:
- Export/import data functionality
